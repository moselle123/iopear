# Project Log

In this time I have:
- Began research into smart systems designed to monitor plants.
- Researched technologies to create my own smart plant system.
- Began experimenting with technologies to see what technologies I want to use.
- Mostly decided on the way I will implement my hardware and my tech stack.

## 14 - 20th October:
This week I have:
- Began buying the hardware that I need to create my project.
- Started building my systems structure and experimenting with my development environment.
- Experimented with getting sensor readings to my raspberry pi.
- Continued research and began planning my gantt chart for the project.

## 21 - 27 October:
This week I:
- Completed first draft of interim report
- Configured project to use docker instead of venv.
- Successfully scanned i2c bus and read from sensors
- Begun building db collections to input sensor data

## 28 - 3 November:
This week:
- Started altering interim report based on suggested changes.
- Lots of troubleshooting for docker to make it easy for development.
- Tested database functions and api calls to get data.


## 28 - 3 November:
This week:
- Created welcome page to set up plant data on first entry to app.
- Implemented more api endpoints to work with frontend
- Improved i2c manager to use i2c bus more safely and efficiently.
- Had a meeting with academic support team about interim report.
- Began reviewing code so far to refactor for better use of Flask.

## 4 - 10 November
This week:
- Refactored code for better modularity (didn't work needs revisiting)
- Refined Interim Report

## 11 - 24 November
- Completed Interim Report
- Continued to work on factory application pattern.
- Connected CO2 Sensor.

## 25 - 8 December
- Slow progress focusing on learning more about flask and content from other modules.
- Begin main work on frontend.

## 9 - 15 December
- No progress

## 16 - 29 December
- Use Pinia for state management
- Fix some issues with API
- Built out basic pages
- Pulled real data from the db to frontend.

## 29 - 5 January
- Created chart component to visualise sensor data through graphs.
- Refactored lots of things to make the functionality of everything cleaner

## 6 - 12 January
- User can update sensor thresholds from within the app.
- User can disabled sensors if they do not need to information collected by them.

## 13 - 19 January
- User can set up events which trigger notifications when their condition is met.
- Fixed various bugs.
- Partially implemented actions.

## 20 - 26 January
- User can trigger actions from the ui
- After meeting with Yi I am going to restructure the way I have implemented my event triggers using a rules engine for more sophisticated logic.
- Started researching rules engine and building out new event system.

## 27 - 2 February
- Discarded idea of using event engine and built out multiple conditions and scheduled events. (Needs implementing within front end).
- Clean up front end and focus on improving the ux.
- Start planning websocket integration and actuator state management

## 3 - 9 February
